## Development

Just run `yarn start`, this watch the files for changes and starts a local web server for developing.

## TODO

* Load specific json files for each page and use the data in the template.
* Maybe instead of using json files for each page, use markdown files
* Write a custom renderer using the pug api to render the markdown files: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug
